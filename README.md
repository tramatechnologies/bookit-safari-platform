## Environment Setup

Before running the project, you need to set up environment variables:

1. **Copy the example environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Get your Supabase credentials:**
   - Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
   - Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

3. **Update your `.env.local` file:**
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```
   
   > **Note:** You can use either `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` or `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - both work!

4. **Restart your development server** after creating/updating the `.env` file

> **Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored and will not be committed to version control. Never share your Supabase keys publicly.

> **Troubleshooting:** If you see "supabaseKey is required" error, make sure your `.env` file exists and contains the correct values. See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](./ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.
